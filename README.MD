# The Complete Javascript Course - Jonas Schmedtmann

## HTML and CSS are from course. Javascript is 100% self-coded.

GAME RULES:
* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds (no computer player)
* In each round, a player can roll as long as neither dice are a one. Each pair value is added to player's ROUND score
    * If player rolls a one, ROUND score is set to 0. This ends current player's round
    * If player chooses to HOLD, his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. This ends current player's round.
* The first player to reach 100 points (or another specified value) on GLOBAL score wins the game
